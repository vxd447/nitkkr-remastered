            <h1>4.Fine Arts</h1>
            <img class="box" src="../images/finearts.jpg" height="250px" width="400px" style="float: right">
            <p class="content">Fine Arts and Modelling club is one of the official clubs of NIT Kurukshetra. It is the hub of artists who
                come together to ameliorate and sustain art culture in the college. And while doing the same, it provides ample 
                opportunities to those with artistic inclination to hone and flaunt their skills with art and craft.</p>
            <p class="content">To uphold the motive of preserving the art culture, Fine Arts and Modelling club turns the 
                college premises into a piece of art during fests. Counting a few endeavours that the club takes on -</p>
            <p class="content">1.<span class="highlights">Backdrop</span>- During Confluence, the annual cultural fest of NIT Kurukshetra, the club members undertake a month-long project
                    of painting a huge canvas to be stretched out across the background at Open  Air Theatre.</p>
            <p class="content">
                    2.<span class="highlights">Wall Paintings</span>- FA club paints 'The Wall' (Apollo wall) during Confluence, for which the members work for days. 
                    In the end it's all worth the efforts because it takes the aura of the fest to a whole new level. With the colors
                    so bright, wall paintings are undoubtedly overwhelming.</p>
            <p class="content">
                3.<span class="highlights">Gallery</span>- An exhibition of artworks is organized wherein art submissions of students from and 
                even outside college are there. It is a perfect platform for an artist to showcase his work not just to the 
                students but to the faculty members who, quite zealously, visit art gallery on Confluence.</p>  
            <p class="content">
                4.<span class="highlights">Anamorphic art</span></art>- It is the art of deception that gets one's eyes into believing a 2dimensional painting to be 
                a 3- dimensional lively scene. Apart from the walls, even the ground doesn't miss the symphony of colors. An art
                of perception, anamorphic art finds its way on the pathway near OAT and in the market.
