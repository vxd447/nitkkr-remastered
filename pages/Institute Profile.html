         country for imparting technical training to youth and for fostering national integration. Its objective was to provide
         instructions and research facilities in various disciplines of engineering and technology and the advancement of
         learning and dissemination of knowledge in each such discipline.</p>
      <p>The first admission to five year B.Sc. (Engg.) degree course was made by the Institute in July, 1963 at Punjab 
        Engineering College , Chandigarh and Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, w:st="on"Patiala , with an intake of 
        60 students at each place. This was repeated in July, 1964 also.  The Institute started functioning on its present campus
        at Kurukshetra from the year 1965-66.  The students were admitted to the first year of the five year integrated B.Sc.
